# This file shows examples of how to configure PATH gateway endpoints using a YAML file as the PADS data source.
# These files will be converted to the proto.GatewayEndpoint struct expected by the PATH External Auth Server (PEAS ).
#
# For details on the expected proto format, see the definition in:
# https://github.com/buildwithgrove/path-external-auth-server/blob/main/proto/gateway_endpoint.proto
endpoints:
  # 1. Example of a gateway endpoint using API Key Authorization
  # This endpoint has no rate limits defined (the rate_limiting field is omitted entirely in this case).
  endpoint_1_static_key: # The unique identifier for a gateway endpoint.
    auth: # The auth field is required for all endpoints that use authorization.
      # The sub-field 'api_key' is required for API Key Authorization.
      # If auth is not set, the endpoint will be treated as using no authorization.
      api_key: "api_key_1" # For API Key Authorization, the API key string is required.

    metadata: # Metadata fields may be any key-value pairs and are optional.
      plan_type: "PLAN_UNLIMITED" # Example of a key-value pair (in this case, a pricing plan).
      account_id: "account_1" # Example of a key-value pair (in this case, an account ID).
      email: "amos.burton@opa.belt" # Example of a key-value pair (in this case, an owner email).

  # 2. Example of a gateway endpoint with no authorization (the auth field is omitted entirely in this case).
  endpoint_2_no_auth:
    rate_limiting: # This endpoint has a rate limit defined
      throughput_limit: 30 # Throughput limit defines the endpoint's per-second (TPS) rate limit.
      capacity_limit: 100000 # Capacity limit defines the endpoint's rate limit over longer periods.
      capacity_limit_period: "CAPACITY_LIMIT_PERIOD_MONTHLY" # Capacity limit period defines the period over which the capacity limit is enforced.

    metadata:
      plan_type: "PLAN_FREE"
      account_id: "account_2"
      email: "frodo.baggins@shire.io"
