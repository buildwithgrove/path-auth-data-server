# This file shows examples of how to configure PATH gateway endpoints using a YAML file as the PADS data source.
# These files will be converted to the proto.GatewayEndpoint struct expected by the PATH's Go External Auth Server.

# For details on the expected proto format, see the definition in 
# envoy/auth_server/proto/gateway_endpoint.proto
