**PADS** (PATH Auth Data Server) is a minimal implementation of the `remote gRPC server` that provides `GatewayEndpoint` data from a data source to [`PEAS (PATH External Auth Server)`](https://github.com/buildwithgrove/path-external-auth-server) in order to authorize requests to the [PATH Gateway](https://github.com/buildwithgrove/path). 

It is part of the GUARD authorization system for PATH and serves as the default implementation of the `remote gRPC server` used in the GUARD Helm charts.

<!-- TODO_MVP(@commoddity): Update link to point to GUARD section of the docs once they are created and published -->
