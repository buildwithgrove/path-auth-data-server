## 1. Introduction

**PADS** (PATH Auth Data Server) is a gRPC server that provides `Gateway Endpoint` data from a data source to the `Go External Authorization Server` in order to enable authorization for [the PATH Gateway](https://github.com/buildwithgrove/path). The nature of the data source is configurable, for example it could be a YAML file or a Postgres database.

## 2. Gateway Endpoints

<!-- TODO_IMPROVE(@commoddity): update link to point to main branch once `envoy-grpc-auth-service` branch is merged -->
[The PATH repo](https://github.com/buildwithgrove/path) contains [the `auth_server` package](https://github.com/buildwithgrove/path/tree/envoy-grpc-auth-service/envoy/auth_server) which contains the `Go External Authorization Server`.

<!-- TODO_IMPROVE(@commoddity): update link to point to main branch once `envoy-grpc-auth-service` branch is merged -->
[This package also defines the `gateway_endpoint.proto` file](https://github.com/buildwithgrove/path/blob/envoy-grpc-auth-service/envoy/auth_server/proto/gateway_endpoint.proto), which contains the definitions for the `GatewayEndpoints` that PADS must provides to the `Go External Authorization Server`.

A single `GatewayEndpoint` represents a single authorized endpoint of the PATH Gateway service, which may be authorized for use by any number of users.

```go
// Simplified representation of the GatewayEndpoint proto message that 
// PADS must provide to the `Go External Authorization Server`.
type GatewayEndpoint struct {
    EndpointId: string
    Auth: {
        RequireAuth: bool
        AuthorizedUsers: map[string]struct{}
    }
    UserAccount: {
        AccountId: string
        PlanType: string
    }
    RateLimiting: {
        ThroughputLimit: int32
        CapacityLimit: int32
        CapacityLimitPeriod: CapacityLimitPeriod [enum]
    }
}
```

## 3. Data Sources

The `server` package contains the `DataSource` interface, which abstracts the data source that provides GatewayEndpoints to the `Go External Authorization Server`.

```go
// AuthDataSource is an interface that abstracts the data source.
// It can be implemented by any data provider (e.g., YAML, Postgres).
type AuthDataSource interface {
	FetchAuthDataSync() (*proto.AuthDataResponse, error)
	AuthDataUpdatesChan() (<-chan *proto.AuthDataUpdate, error)
}

```

- `FetchAuthDataSync()` returns the full set of Gateway Endpoints.
  - This is called when `PADS` starts to populate its Gateway Endpoint Data Store.
- `AuthDataUpdatesChan()` returns a channel that receives auth data updates to the Gateway Endpoints.
  - Updates are streamed as changes are made to the data source.

### 3.1. YAML

If the `YAML_FILEPATH` environment variable is set, PADS will load the data from a YAML file at the specified path.

Hot reloading is supported, so changes to the YAML file will be reflected in the `Go External Authorization Server` without the need to restart PADS.

The YAML file must be formatted as follows:

```yaml
endpoints:
  endpoint_1:
    endpoint_id: "endpoint_1"
    auth:
      require_auth: true
      authorized_users:
        "auth0|user_1": {}
    user_account:
      account_id: "account_1"
      plan_type: "PLAN_UNLIMITED"

  endpoint_2:
    endpoint_id: "endpoint_2"
    auth:
      require_auth: false
    user_account:
      account_id: "account_2"
      plan_type: "PLAN_FREE"
    rate_limiting:
      throughput_limit: 30
      capacity_limit: 100000
      capacity_limit_period: "CAPACITY_LIMIT_PERIOD_MONTHLY"
```

### 3.2. Postgres

If the `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable is set, PADS will connect to the specified Postgres database.

The connected Postgres database must contain the tables and schema defined in the [`postgres/sqlc/schema.sql`](postgres/sqlc/schema.sql) file.

## 4. gRPC Proto File

<!-- TODO_IMPROVE(@commoddity): update link to point to main branch once `envoy-grpc-auth-service` branch is merged -->
[The PATH `auth_server` package](https://github.com/buildwithgrove/path/tree/envoy-grpc-auth-service/envoy/auth_server) contains the file `gateway_endpoint.proto`, which contains:
- The gRPC auto-generated Go struct definitions for the GatewayEndpoints.
- The `FetchAuthDataSync` and `StreamAuthDataUpdates` methods that the `Go External Authorization Server` uses to populate and update its Gateway Endpoint Data Store.

<!-- TODO_IMPROVE(@commoddity): update link to point to main branch once `envoy-grpc-auth-service` branch is merged -->
The autogenerated Go code from [the `gateway_endpoint.proto` file](https://github.com/buildwithgrove/path/blob/envoy-grpc-auth-service/envoy/auth_server/proto/gateway_endpoint.proto) is installed in PADS from the `github.com/buildwithgrove/path/envoy/auth_server` package.
